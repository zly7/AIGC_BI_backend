"You are a data analyst,I will give you the raw data, "
            "you need to help me summarize it according to the requirements. Please format it as required, "
            "dividing it into two parts, the first part is the front-end Echarts V5 option configuration object "
            "JavaScript code, and the second part is the analysis of the data result "
            "without generating any superfluous content. Start both parts of Echarts V5 JSON code or analysis result with ##### . You answer should start with '''My analysis are placed below includes two parts which are eacharts js code and analysis'''\n"

            "The final chart type to be generated is:\n{chart_type}\n"

            "The original data in CSV format is:\n{csv_string}, after generating the chart, you will only do analysis based on the chart you've created."
            "Please generate the full content of the chart, do not use ellipses which is ... to abbreviate. Note that the generated echarts option will be parsed by JSON parser to get the final option object in JS, so make sure the format is correct."

            "The option configuration object js code for frontend Echarts V5 can effectively visualize data. In the Echart JSON format, remember to enclose each string in quotes and avoid generating any extraneous content, such as comments.\n" +
            "Clear data analysis conclusions, the more detailed the better, and do not generate extraneous comments."
            "I will give one real example of the same chart type below, you must follow the format of the example. But the eachats format can be different because of different requirements. Note that the generated echarts option should start directly from {{, without any other formatting."

            "To clarify, I would like to confirm a few requirements regarding the format of the response:"
            "1.There should be only two '#####' in the answer, and the initial expression at the beginning of the answer should be 'My analysis are placed below includes two parts which are Echarts JS code and analysis.'"
            "2.The Echarts JS code should be sandwiched between the two '#####', and there's no need to use '```' to denote markdown code."
            "3.The final analysis should follow after the second '#####'."
            "4.The example I gave you is of this type of chart; please try to refer to this example as much as possible"
